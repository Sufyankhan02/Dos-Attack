This Python script creates a simple DoS attack toolthat prompts the user for the victim's IP address and sends crafted HTTP requests to the target server. 
Remember, launching DoS attacks against unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical. This script is for educational purposes only.
The script begins by importing the socket module, which provides access to the BSD socket interface.
The dos_attack function is defined to carry out the DoS attack.
The user is prompted to enter the IP address of the victim using the input function.
A while loop is used to continuously attempt the DoS attack.
Inside the loop, a socket is created and connected to the victim's IP address on port 80.
The script sends a crafted HTTP request to the victim's IP address to simulate the DoS attack.
If an error occurs during the attack, an error message is displayed.
The socket is closed after each attack iteration.
The dos_attack function is called when the script is executed.
